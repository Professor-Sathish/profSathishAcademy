# Rules for Constructing Integer Constants

Integer constants in C represent whole numbers (no decimal or fractional parts) and can be written in **decimal**, **octal**, or **hexadecimal** notation. This document outlines the general rules for creating valid integer constants, including optional prefixes and suffixes.

## 1. Basic Forms

### 1.1 Decimal Constants
- Composed of digits **0–9**.
- Must **not** begin with **0** unless the constant is exactly `0`.
- Examples:
  - `123`
  - `0` *(special case)*
  - `9456`

### 1.2 Octal Constants
- Indicated by a leading **`0`** (zero).
- Composed of digits **0–7** only.
- Examples:
  - `0123` (equivalent to decimal 83)
  - `0777` (equivalent to decimal 511)

### 1.3 Hexadecimal Constants
- Indicated by a leading **`0x`** or **`0X`**.
- Composed of digits **0–9** and letters **A–F** or **a–f**.
- Examples:
  - `0x1A` (equivalent to decimal 26)
  - `0XFF` (equivalent to decimal 255)
  - `0x7beef`

## 2. Sign and Negative Numbers

- **Integer constants themselves** are always non-negative.  
- A **negative integer** (e.g., `-10`) is treated as the **unary minus** operator applied to the positive constant `10`.
  
  ```
  int x = -10;  // Here, the literal is 10; the '-' is an operator.
  ```

## 3. Optional Type Suffixes

C allows suffixes to specify the type (e.g., long, unsigned, long long). Common suffixes include.

- u or U for unsigned
- l or L for long
- ll or LL for long long

You can combine them as appropriate. Some examples:

- 10U → unsigned int
- 10L → long int
- 10UL → unsigned long int
- 10LL → long long int
- 10ULL → unsigned long long int

```
123U   // unsigned int
0777L  // long int (octal)
0xFFull // unsigned long long int (hex)

```

## 4. Invalid Forms
1. Leading zero in a decimal constant (e.g., 0129) is invalid because it suggests octal notation, and 9 is not a valid octal digit.
   
2. Underscores (like in some other languages) are not allowed (e.g., 1_000 is invalid in C).
   
3. Non-hex letters in a hex constant (e.g., 0xG1) is invalid.
Whitespace within the constant (e.g., 12 34) is invalid.

# 5. Examples of Valid Integer Constants

1.**Decimal**: 0, 15, 999, 2023U, 3000000000UL.

2.**Octal**: 0777, 0644, 032LL.

3.**Hexadecimal**: 0x1F, 0XAF, 0x7fff, 0xCAFEBABELL.

## 6. Quick Reference
- **Decimal**: [1-9][0-9]* or just 0 .
- **Octal**: 0[0-7]* .
- **Hex**: 0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+ .
- **Suffixes**: (u|U)?(l|L)?(l|L)? (in various valid combinations).
- **Negative Integers**: Use unary minus: -10 (the literal is 10, preceded by - operator).
