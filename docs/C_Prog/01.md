# What is C ?

C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language created by **Dennis Ritchie** in the early 1970s. It is known for:

- **Efficiency**: C allows low-level memory manipulation and gives you fine-grained control over how your code interacts with the hardware.

- **Portability**: Well-written C programs can be compiled to run on a variety of hardware platforms with minimal changes.

- **Influence**: Many popular languages (C++, Java, C#, Objective-C) trace their syntax and concepts back to C.
