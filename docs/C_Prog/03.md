# Getting Started with C

## Install a C Compiler

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection): Very common on Linux and available for Windows (via MinGW or Cygwin) and macOS (via Homebrew).
  
- **Clang**: Another widely used compiler, often the default on macOS.
  
- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Bundled with Microsoft’s development tools for Windows.

## Choose an Editor or IDE

- **Suggested Text Editor** : Visual Studio Code.

- **Suggested IDE** : Code::Blocks.

## Download MingGW : 

A native Windows port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), with freely distributable import libraries and header files for building native Windows applications; includes extensions to the MSVC runtime to support C99 functionality. All of MinGW's software will execute on the 64bit Windows platforms.


Download [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)

## Installation Guide for MingGW :

1. Download the Installer :
    - Go to the MinGW SourceForge page or (historically) the MinGW website.
    - Look for the mingw-get-setup.exe or any official installer.
  
2.Run the Installer :

- **Choose components**:
  
- **mingw32-base:** The basic setup with the GCC compiler.
- **mingw32-gcc-g++:** Adds C++ compiler support (if you need C++).
- **mingw32-gdb:** GNU Debugger.
- **msys-base:** MSYS shell for make and related tools.


3.Install to a directory (e.g., C:\MinGW).

4.Set Environment Variables.(Windows OS)

- Add the bin folder (e.g., C:\MinGW\bin) to your system’s PATH.
- Start Menu → Edit the system environment variables.
- Click Environment Variables….
- Under System variables, select Path, then Edit…, and add C:\MinGW\bin.

5.Verify by opening Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing.
```
gcc --version
```
You should see GCC version information if everything is set up correctly.
