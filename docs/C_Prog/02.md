# Which C are we learning ?

In most modern references, you will be learning standard C (sometimes called “ANSI C” or “ISO C”)—this refers to the C language as defined by the ISO standards committee. Over the years, C has been standardized multiple times:

- C89/C90: The first standardized version of C (ANSI/ISO).

- C99: Introduced features like variable-length arrays, inline functions, and improved support for inline assembly.

- C11: Focused on concurrency and some improvements to the standard library.

- C17: Mostly a bug-fix release over C11.

- C23: The newest revision adds minor features and clarifications, though not yet widespread.

Despite these versions, the fundamental principles of C remain consistent. 

Beginners typically learn a version that’s close to C99 or C11. 

Most compilers today default to at least **C99** or **C11** by default.
